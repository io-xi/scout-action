The `docker/scout-action` is a GitHub Action used in Docker Scout. It is used to analyze Docker images for vulnerabilities and other security issues. 

In the Docker Scout CLI release notes version 1.6.1, it was mentioned that this release only affects the `docker/scout-action` GitHub Action. New features were added to support passing in SBOM files in SDPX or in-toto SDPX format and SBOM files in `syft-json` format. Here is an example of how to use it:

```yaml
uses: docker/scout-action@v1
with:
    command: cves
    image: sbom://alpine.spdx.json
```

```yaml
uses: docker/scout-action@v1
with:
    command: cves
    image: sbom://alpine.syft.json
```
